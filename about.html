<h1>About Me</h1>


<h2>Eunice Gathoni - Web Developer</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm Eunice, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a focus on creating intuitive, responsive, and high-performance websites. With a strong background in both front-end and back-end development, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a variety of modern frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as server-side technologies like Node.js and PHP.</p>

<p>I specialize in building dynamic, user-centric web applications that deliver seamless experiences across devices. Whether working on an e-commerce platform, a corporate website, or a custom web solution, I take pride in my ability to solve complex problems, optimize performance, and bring ideas to life.</p>

<p>In addition to coding, I have experience with databases, version control (Git), and modern development practices like Agile and Test-Driven Development (TDD). I am always learning and adapting to new technologies and trends in the ever-evolving field of web development.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy [Exploring new tech trends, Contributing to open-source projects, andxperimenting with creative design].

<p>Let's build something amazing together!</p>
